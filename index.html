        Research and Development Manpower Full Time Equivalence by Sector in
        Singapore
      </h1>

      <p class="ps">
        Visualize and analyse sector wise, year wise, manpower wise full time
        equivalance data in Research and Development in Singapore. One full-time
        equivalence (FTE) unit may be thought of as one person-year. A person
        who spends 30% of his time on R&D and the rest on other activities
        during the one-year reporting period should be considered as 0.3 FTE. If
        a fulltime R&D worker is employed for only six months during the one
        year reporting period, this results in a 0.5 FTE
